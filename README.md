# Product installer
With this extension, products from Oveleon can be registered, managed and installed.

#### ToDo
- Create product overview
- Create product update process
- Optimize styles in Firefox (Firefox does not support the `:has()` selector)
- Provide all dependencies for manual installation (Download packages)
- Create database and migration process
- Queries within the steps should check if the user is still logged in, otherwise issue an error message
- Use translations everywhere
- Set bundle license
- Set bundle to public
